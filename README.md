# Netbox Device Types

Sets of CSV files that can be imported via the Web GUI in [Netbox](https://github.com/digitalocean/netbox).

All data has been taken directly from manufacturer data sheets.

Directory heirarchy is as follows:

1. Manufacturer.  (e.g. Cisco/Meraki/Checkpoint)
2. Device Catagory. (e.g. Router/Switch/Firewall)
3. CSV file containing a logical grouping of devices (eg. Cisco ISR 4000 series routers/Meraki MX series routers)

Example:

`Cisco/Routers/isr-4000.csv`
